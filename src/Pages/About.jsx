                    <p>I'm a photographer and a videographer living in Paris,France.</p>
                    <p>interested in how camera can capture moments and make people feel better.</p>
                    <p className='mt-10'>   I started taking photo  honing my visual design skills and learning the ins and outs of every frame, then moved into the world of capturing moments.</p>
                    <p className='mt-10'> As a designer, I enjoy being a generalist with a focus on craft and prototyping. I value beautiful visuals backed by smart systems thinking. I love the concept that a capturing moments is a living thing that can adapt and evolve over time. <br /></p>
                    <p className='mt-10'> Outside of design, I love food in all capacities. I spend my time exploring new restaurants, testing new products.If you want to chat, feel free to reach out.</p>
